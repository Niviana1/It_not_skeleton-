```cs
# Changes:

  - Major Stability problem fixed
  - Random crashes fixed
  - Changed the toast to "Hydrogen is ready!" since Reha can't trust me. Here you go release it now.

You must **COMPLETELY DELETE ROBLOX FIRST** and download Hydrogen to get this update.

To update, first uninstall Roblox, then visit https://www.mediafire.com/file/azhhuxfmz8pe0dr/HYDROGEN_614_byAlysse.apk/file and click the download button. Install the client and launch the game.
